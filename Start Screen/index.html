                <p>it is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from their base on the moon Yavin Four, 
                    have started their first battle against the evil Galactic Empire. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plan is to destroy  the Empireâ€™s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, 
                    an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    During the battle, the legendary star pilot Luke Skywalker
                    has been chosen to attempt a
                    dangerous trench run that will lead to the only vulnerablility of the death star
                    and restore freedom to the galaxy
                </p>

                <p>
